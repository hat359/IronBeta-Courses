Using an inquiry framework, students practice reading and analyzing articles, research studies, and foundational, literary, and philosophical texts; listening to and viewing speeches, broadcasts, and personal accounts; and experiencing artistic works and performances. Students learn to synthesize information from multiple sources, develop their own perspectives in research-based written essays, and design and deliver oral and visual presentations, both individually and as part of a team. Ultimately, the course aims to equip students with the power to analyze and evaluate information with accuracy and precision in order to craft and communicate evidence-based arguments. Be very clear in your counseling of students that taking only the Seminar course will not be as productive as taking the 2 course sequence and there is no special recognition for taking just the Seminar course.","1127",Electives-Others,278,General,187,Research and Critical Thinking,1070,"Honors, IB, AP, AICE, advanced college-preparatory course",1075,Year,"1132","1.00",1095,1099,AP Course,"1150",No,"9, 10, 11, 12","10,11,12","1136","4.00","1138","5.00",http://www.cpalms.org/Public/PreviewCourse/Preview/10451,"1142",No,"",None,N,619,1107,High School & Adult Education,Section 3 -Grades 9 to 12 and Adult Education Course Listing,1117,0,Y,N,"1140",No,"0","0","1148",No,"0.00","0.00",0,"0","0",,"","","1","20/07/18 19:20","1.1.1.1","1","20/07/18 19:20","2.2.2.2",0
